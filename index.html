                    <p>When I was thirteen years old, I started working in the bakery.  This job was more like learning than a job but it was interesting to know.  During the summer vacations I was in this bakery helping a man who needed help with anything like moving flour from one place to another or watching the oven while he was eating or resting or helping customers.

        The smell of chocolate, cinnamon, sugar, vanilla and honey when making the cookies made me interested to learn more.  When a person doesn’t have any experience making breads, everything is an adventure. The process of making pastries and breads takes a few years to learn. 

        By touching the dough, I will know what is necessary to do; if it needs more water or more time mixing.  The dough to make a French baguette has to be not too soft or rough, and the dough has to be able to stretch like a rubber band.  Then we weigh it up, and let it set for fifteen minutes. Then it’s ready to proof for forty minutes, before baking with a high temperature and steam.</p>
